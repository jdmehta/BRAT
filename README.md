# BRAT
Bipedal Robotic Articulating Transport
## What is it?
This is a robot which walks like a human, employing bipedal motion. This is done using 8 servo motors controlled using an AVR microcontroller,  the ATmega-32.
## Reference Material
`BRAT-Report.pdf` is the report my team and I prepared for this project. This was our final year project for Bachelor of Engineering. All hardware and software implementation details can be found here. Since you are here, you would most likely be looking for the logic running on the microcontroller which controls this robot, for which I would refer you to Section 4.4 of this report, where the complete algorithm is described in the best possible way an engineer can!
## Of time lapses and memories
It has been over 3 years since this code was finalized and over 4 years since we started on this project. There has been no development since. On one hand time erases some memories (remembering how we got everything to work) and on the other it makes me laugh at my older immaturish implementation of this solution! Nevertheless, I hope that this can be a good starting point for you to build your project idea on and take our work forward.
